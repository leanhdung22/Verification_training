This directory contains an example protocol monitor from the Verification 
Academy coverage cookbook. There is also a testbench which is intended as an
example that users can run to see what the monitor does.

To run the example:

cd sim
make


The Makefile in the sim directory will compile and simulate the testbench
containing the monitor in Questa. If the process is successful there will be
a UVM_TEST_PASSED message issued at the end of the simulation.

If you would like to run the simulation interactively in the Questa GUI so
that you can look at waveforms, assertions, covergroups etc:

make simgui
